This will produce an ANOVA for my data so I can see if there is any variation in the data related to the location of the butterfly species.
I will use the Honestly Significant Difference (Tukeyâ€™s HSD) post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons to see what exaclty is differnet in my data. from there I will plot it to get a visual.
